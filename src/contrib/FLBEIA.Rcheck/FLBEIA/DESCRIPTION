Description: A simulation toolbox that describes a fishery system under
    a Management Strategy Estrategy approach. The objective of the model is
    to facilitate the Bio-Economic evaluation of Management strategies. It is
    multistock, multifleet and seasonal. The simulation is divided in 2 main blocks,
    the Operating Model (OM) and the Management Procedure (MP). In turn, each of these
    two blocks is divided in 3 components: the biological, the fleets and the
    covariables on the one hand, and the observation, the assessment and
    the advice on the other.
Depends: methods, R(>= 3.2.3), FLCore (>= 2.6.5), FLFleet, ggplot2
